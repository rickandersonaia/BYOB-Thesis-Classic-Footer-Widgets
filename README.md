# BYOB-Thesis-Classic-Footer-Widgets
A Free Box for Thesis 2.1+

Places a row of widgets in the footer in the Thesis Classic Responsive Skin.  It <strong>REQUIRES</strong> Thesis 2.1.  This will generally work in any of the DIYThemes skins, although it may require some custom CSS and may not work in others.

## Instructions for use

The box is intended to work automatically without adjusting and settings.  Once it is installed and activated it will create 
4 widget areas and place them in the footer.  All you need to do is save Skin Design options (so the CSS gets written) and
you are finished.

### Settings

In the Thesis Home >> Boxes >> Footer Widgets menu you can adjust the number and placement of the widget areas.  You can:
- Choose between 1 and 4 widget areas to display
- Choose any hook that the skin creates to place the widgets
- Choose to place it in one of the 4 Thesis hook locations
    * hook_above
    * hook_top
    * hook_bottom
    * hook_below
- Set a priority for hook placement
